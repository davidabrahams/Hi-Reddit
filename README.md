# Hi Reddit (AKA Ask Snoo Anything)
### David Abrahams (@[greneroom](github.com/greneroom)), Yuzhong Huang (@[YuzhongHuang](github.com/yuzhonghuang)), Nora Mohamed (@[nmohamed](github.com/nmohamed)), & Lucy Wilcox (@[LucyWilcox](github.com/lucywilcox))

### What is this?
___**Ask Snoo Anything**___ is an Android app that takes your voice as input and outputs an occasionally funny comment from Reddit. Want to know who some random user on Reddit thinks is a pretty cool person? Or maybe, you want to hear the opinion of some Redditor on moldy bread - if so, then this app is for you. Download it from the Play Store ~~here~~ (app not yet available).

### Why?
We thought it'd be funny. Also, it's a project for Olin's Mobile Prototyping course.
